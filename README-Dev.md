### **Backend Cheat Sheet**

#### **Goal**:
To create a **reference tool** for developers that organizes and provides links to essential backend resources, each with a detailed description in both **German** and **English**.

#### **Tech Stack**:
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express (or similar), MongoDB
- **API**: REST API to fetch backend links from MongoDB
- **Languages**: JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript

#### **Features**:
- Display links with descriptions in both **English** and **German**.
- Toggle between **German** and **English** explanations dynamically.
- Highlight relevant links for quick access.
- Fast switching between languages (important for UX).

#### **Learning Focus**:
- **React & TypeScript**: Refining your skills with types, components, props, and state management.
- **Backend (MongoDB)**: CRUD operations, API routes, and interacting with MongoDB via **Mongoose**.
- **Deployment**: Choosing the best platform based on needs (e.g., Next.js, Vercel, Netlify).
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Implementing language toggles.
