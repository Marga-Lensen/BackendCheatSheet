one by one is better.

are they all independent or should we do things in a logical order?

I would like to apply the highlight on Express Middleware first; see how that works, and then I can send the cheat sheet to my classmates soon, and help them see through the list better.

second, I want to offer the german version when available. your plan sounds solid and doable, and I am excited to implement it.

then I want to change the array by simply adding one more field: category. That sounds like a very versatile approach to do further conditional rendering or other methods such as sorting.
last, i want to learn the coding how to sort the table dynamically. 

-----------------
That sounds like a perfect plan! Here‚Äôs the **logical order** to implement everything:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Highlight important links** (quickest win, immediate impact for your classmates).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Implement language switching** (adds functionality without changing the data structure).  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Add a `category` field to the array** (prepares for sorting/grouping).  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Sort the table dynamically** (final step, improves readability).

## **Step 1: Highlight "Express Middleware"**
We‚Äôll highlight the links dynamically using **conditional rendering**.  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Modify Your Component**
Inside your `.map()` function where you render the table rows:  
```jsx
const highlightedLinks = ["Express Middleware", "REST API Basics"]; // Add more if needed

<table>
  <tbody>
    {links.map((item) => (
      <tr key={item.url}>
        <td
          className={highlightedLinks.includes(item.title) ? "highlight" : ""}
        >
          <a href={item.url} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            {item.title}
          </a>
        </td>
      </tr>
    ))}
  </tbody>
</table>
```

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Add CSS Styling**
Add this to your `.scss` or `.css` file:  
```scss
.highlight {
  color: goldenrod;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

---

## ‚úÖ **Test it**
- Run your app and check if "Express Middleware" is highlighted!  
- Try adding other important links to `highlightedLinks` to see them change dynamically.

## **Next Steps**
Once this works, we‚Äôll move on to **language switching**. Let me know when you‚Äôre ready! üöÄ
